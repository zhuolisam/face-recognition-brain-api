 # Smart Brain - Face Recognition App API
Backend of final project for ZTM course. It servers the face recognition API from Clarifai and connects to the database.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the `image.js` file to connect to Clarifai API.
5. You will need a postgreSQL server running on your machine for this to work. Connect them in your server.js based on your own details.
You can grab Clarifai API key at [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)

**Make sure you use postgreSQL instead of mySQL for this code base.
